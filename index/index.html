            <h1>Our approach to reopening our stores</h1>
            <p>First, let's remember how we got here. In China, and later around the world, we were one of the first
                companies to close our stores. In Greater China, we saw the importance of swift action — and the
                critical importance of social distance — to slow the virus’ spread. And, as time has gone on, we’ve
                continued to refine and expand our in‑store health and safety measures, which have proven so effective
                in places like Greater China, where our stores have been safely open for months.</p>
